# RPCForECELinux
This repository contains the C source code for my remote procedure call (RPC) program for 
uWaterloo's ECELinux servers. The client and server programs present in this repository 
were written in order to satisfy the requirements for Assignment 1 of ECE 454 (Distributed 
Computing) in the Spring 2014 term.

The skeleton and headers for this project were provided by Prof. Mahesh Tripunitara. The 
rest of the source code was written by Justin Cheung and Evgeny Nam.
